title:  "Project Euler #111: Prime-Fu in Rust"
categories: math, cs
---

Project Euler is very special to me. I found it in high school before I had any exposure to programming or CS. Guided by its many fascinating problems and solution forums, I taught myself to code --- first in Java, then in Python, then in Haskell, which I discovered through some freaky one-liners in the solutions vault. I also discovered high-octane CS concepts that I didn't understand at the time but whose mystery encouraged me to dive into the field in college.

[Problem 111](https://projecteuler.net/problem=111) asks us to compute

$$\begin{align}
\Sigma(10) &:= \sum_{d=0}^9 S(10, d) \\
    &= \sum_{d=0}^9 \sum_{\text{10-digit primes $p$}} p \mathbb I[\text{digit $d$ occurs the maximum number of times in $p$}],
\end{align}$$

that is, for each decimal digit $d$, to find the maximal number of times it can occur in a 10-digit prime and sum up all the primes with this maximal number of $d$s. For example, $d=1$ can occur at most 3 times in a 4-digit prime,

$$S(4, 1) = 1117 + 1151 + 1171 + 1181 + 1511 + 1811 + 2111 + 4111 + 8111 = 22275,$$

and $\Sigma(4) = 273700$.

## Brute force + Python

The dumbest possible code in the least performant possible language rarely does an Euler problem solve. That's not gonna stop this rat from [pulling the sugar lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber):

```py
from sympy import sieve

# Number of occurrences of digit `d` in integer `n`
def n_occs(n, d):
    return sum(c == str(d) for c in str(n))

def S(n, d):
    max_occs = 0
    s = 0
    # Check all `n`-digit primes, keeping sum for running max `n_occs`
    for p in sieve.primerange(10 ** (n - 1), 10**n):
        occs = n_occs(p, d)
        if occs > max_occs:
            max_occs = occs
            s = p
        elif occs == max_occs:
            s += p
    return s

n = 10
print(sum(S(n, d) for d in range(10)))
```

I'm not willing to wait around for this code to complete. The trouble with brute force, of course, is that the prime-counting function $\pi(x)$ grows as $x/\log x$, so our code's runtime should be just about exponential in `n`. Indeed it is:

Extrapolating out the exponential fit suggests $\Sigma(10)$ will take about 3 hours to compute. Hey, if we can get a ~50x speedup from a bare-metal language, this will take under 4 minutes. How about Rust?

## Brute force + Rust

After writing out the Python I saw a simple optimization: rather than iterating through all `n`-digit primes for each `d` to find the maximum number of digit occurrences, we can just scan once and maintain a single 10-vector of running maximum `digit_counts`. I don't think this insight is enough to drop the "brute force" designation, though.

```rust
use primal::{self, Sieve};

fn digit_counts(mut p: usize) -> [usize; 10] {
    let mut counts = [0; 10];
    while p > 0 {
        let d = p % 10;
        counts[d] += 1;
        p /= 10;
    }
    return counts;
}

fn sigma(sieve: &Sieve, n: u32) -> usize {
    let mut max_digit_counts = [0; 10];
    let mut ss = [0; 10];

    let min_p = usize::pow(10, n - 1);
    for p in sieve.primes_from(min_p).take_while(|x| *x < 10 * min_p) {
        let counts = digit_counts(p);
        for d in 0..10 {
            if counts[d] > max_digit_counts[d] {
                // We have a new max repeat digit count; reset count and sum
                max_digit_counts[d] = counts[d];
                ss[d] = p;
            } else if counts[d] == max_digit_counts[d] {
                ss[d] += p;
            }
        }
    }
    return ss.iter().sum();
}

fn main() {
    let n = 10;

    let sieve = Sieve::new(usize::pow(10, n));
    println!("{}", sigma(&sieve, n));
}
```

Nothing interesting here, just brushing up on Rust semantics. This runs in about 2 and a half minutes on my machine --- we got the speedup we wanted! However, 1-5 minutes is the uncanny valley of Euler solution runtimes: you're definitely missing something big if it's taking this long. Okay, let's try to find that big thing, and stick with Rust for fun.

## Earnest attempt + Rust

What's killing us is obviously iterating over $\pi(10^{10}) - \pi(10^9) \approx 10^{10} / \log 10^{10} \approx 400\text{M}$ primes. That's a lot of primes --- so many, in fact, that I wager we are highly likely to find an `n`-digit prime with `n-1` or `n-2` occurrences of _any_ digit. Furthermore, in general there aren't that many `n`-digit numbers mostly containing a single digit `d`. Rather than taking primes and checking if they have a lot of `d`s, can we generate numbers with a lot of `d`s and check if they're prime?

```rust
use itertools::Itertools;
use primal::is_prime;

// Get `n`-digit number with `free_digits` at given indices and `d`s elsewhere
// Ex: build_number(4, 1, [5, 6], [0, 2]) => 5161
fn build_number(
    n: usize,
    d: usize,
    free_digits: &Vec<usize>,
    free_digit_indices: &Vec<usize>,
) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut digits = vec![d; n];
    for i in 0..free_digits.len() {
        digits[free_digit_indices[i]] = free_digits[i];
    }
    if digits[0] == 0 {
        // Not an n-digit number
        None
    } else {
        let number = digits.iter().fold(0, |n, d| n * 10 + d);
        Some(number)
    }
}

// Get all `n`-digit integers with `k` occurrences of digit `d`.
fn n_digit_numbers_with_k_ds(n: usize, k: usize, d: usize) -> Vec<usize> {
    let n_free_digits = n - k;
    let non_d_digits = (0..10).filter(|x| *x != d);
    // Get all `n_free_digits`-tuples of non-`d` digits
    let free_digits_choices = vec![non_d_digits; n_free_digits]
        .into_iter()
        .multi_cartesian_product();
    // Order matters in free digits (e.g. we have both [1, 2] and [2, 1]), so order-independent
    // combinations of indices suffice to construct all integers
    let free_digit_indices_choices = (0..n).combinations(n_free_digits);

    let mut numbers = Vec::new();
    for free_digits in free_digits_choices {
        for free_digit_indices in free_digit_indices_choices.clone() {
            match build_number(n, d, &free_digits, &free_digit_indices) {
                Some(n) => numbers.push(n),
                None => (),
            }
        }
    }
    numbers
}

fn s(n: usize, d: usize) -> usize {
    // Consider first `n`-digit primes with `n` `d`s, then `n-1` `d`s, etc. We can stop as soon as
    // we find a nonempty set.
    for k in (0..n + 1).rev() {
        let mut n_digit_primes_with_k_ds = n_digit_numbers_with_k_ds(n, k, d)
            .into_iter()
            .filter(|p| is_prime(*p as u64))
            .peekable();
        if n_digit_primes_with_k_ds.peek().is_some() {
            return n_digit_primes_with_k_ds.sum::<usize>();
        }
    }
    panic!();
}

fn main() {
    let n = 10;
    println!("{}", (0..10).map(|d| s(n, d)).sum::<usize>());
}
```

This runs in a fraction of a second.

This last implementation ended up being a fairer fight against the compiler than I care to admit, with iterators and the borrow checker knocking me back at every turn. It's very hard to imagine a case for Rust being in your top 3 tools for Project Euler. But it's fun!
