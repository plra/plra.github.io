You know the deal!

**jackzebra - 弓长张** (2024)
<lite-youtube videoid="TDc4yZXLqfI"></lite-youtube>
\#1 Chinese trapper jackzebra blasts the far East drain contingent to the top of the leaderboard. All the beats on here go crazy.

**Schnuffel - Häschenparty** (2008)
<lite-youtube videoid="jSwV3IpNF2U"></lite-youtube>
A towering achievement. A perfect little green apple Jolly Rancher for the ears. These rabbits have got a hold on me. I hear the Häschenalarm in my sleep.

**Rrose x Polygonia - Dermatology** (2024)
<lite-youtube videoid="ol4QhSmUq_Q"></lite-youtube>
I return to Rrose again and again. That crafty brain technician. Spine-tingling psychoacoustic potions splash onto 5am wormhole techno. Go see the live act!

**Acid Souljah - Off the Yae** (2024)
<lite-youtube videoid="Lu-tuV7kD4U"></lite-youtube>

**N.E.D.S. Kru feat. The Wee Man - Here You (That'll Be Right)** (2007)
<lite-youtube videoid="KHTKyhyMTbw"></lite-youtube>
I'm no authority on Scottish cultural history, but what I'm guessing happened here is approximately the following: the (one-man?) NEDS Kru & Wee Man thought they'd make a track affectionately ribbing their local Glasgow ned ("**n**on-**e**ducated **d**elinquent") community in a Trailer Park Boys-esque documentary effort, but accidentally made a banger whose bangerdom transcended the mission. I've jammed this on the train to work an embarrassing number of times, daydreaming of Buckfast and random street fights.

**Doctor Jeep - Machine Learning** (2023)
<lite-youtube videoid="mDb2LwDrk3w"></lite-youtube>
Some of the freshest & hardest-hitting dance tracks I've heard in years, period, exclamation point. And a friend of a friend, apparently!

**BADSISTA - Montagem da Xereca** (2023)
<lite-youtube videoid="2KAOGl-e3ZA"></lite-youtube>
The distorted kicks in here really do it for me. This summer was the big Baile / Mandelão kick for me. Most of the tracks keep up with my recent high-tempo fixations, and it's a lot more challenging & fun to mix than house or techno.

**DJ Blakes - A Lenda** (2023)
<lite-youtube videoid="Is4wxO1VGhM"></lite-youtube>
Sampling the Quran, System of a Down, Like a G6 and a nuclear reactor alarm all within 3 minutes is genuinely insane. The video makes me laugh too. I gotta make it to Brazil.

**DJ Black Low - Uwami** (2021)
<lite-youtube videoid="MmsCoJjBT6o"></lite-youtube>
Pretoria's Black Low writes an epic in his own melodic and phraseological language. I love the patient evolution and little energy shots sprinkled throughout this album.

**Dry Cleaning - New Long Leg** (2021)
<lite-youtube videoid="Tn9bH7UgiCc"></lite-youtube>
Totally disaffected spoken post-punk from 9th-inning Britain. Lyrics could stand on their own. Bits of Massive Attack, My Dad Is Dead and Lebanon Hanover in there.

**CCCP Fedeli alla Linea - Ortodossia** (1985)
<lite-youtube videoid="gP1X147W1b0"></lite-youtube>
An absolute ripper of an EP from my favorite Italian band. No wasted seconds. Don't miss _Punk Islam_! What especially amazes me about CCCP is that their 1990 return as chainsmoking serious post-post-punks yielded _Epica Etica Etnica Pathos_, which for me is a masterpiece.

**Suzy Sheer - Euphoriphilia** (2024)
<lite-youtube videoid="go-BLM4VEFI"></lite-youtube>
I guess this falls somewhere under the pavilion of TikTok postverbal brainmelt music. Those little doggie yapping sounds near the end really hit.

**Golden Boy - Chao Garden** (2020)
<lite-youtube videoid="480CEd8X-Ec"></lite-youtube>
RIP. Golden Boy was a virtuoso in this raved-up breakcore-hardcore style. The open hihats on this record will slice your head off. Play this for your friends for a guaranteed strong reaction.
