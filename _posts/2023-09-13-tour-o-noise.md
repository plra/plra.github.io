I cannot for the life of me find the source of this quote, my favorite description of any musical genre, but here it is: "Noise has got to be the only genre that has more artists than fans." If that doesn't pique your interest, what will? This is a brief intro to noise --- defined broadly to include power electronics, the abrasive end of industrial, and some even more blasphemous corners --- through some of the tracks I've most enjoyed over the years.

**Kevin Drumm - Hitting the Pavement** (_Sheer Hellish Miasma_, 2007)
<lite-youtube videoid="4McQmtLx0HA"></lite-youtube>
A great choice for a first encounter with noise music if I do say so myself. Patient, dramatic and sure to tickle your cochleae.

**Prurient - Military Road** (_Pleasure Ground_, 2006)
<lite-youtube videoid="1XRQBHNDXmE"></lite-youtube>
Ringing ears, artillery fire and some psychopath screaming over the combat radio. One of the most unhinged vocal performances of all time.

**White Suns - Clairvoyant** (_Totem_, 2014)
<lite-youtube videoid="wARjfnThpk8"></lite-youtube>
Yeah, it's noise rock (yawn!!!!!!) but few rockers summon as substantial an offering to the entropy gods as White Suns. Lyrics also very #relatable.

**Aaron Dilloway - Body Chaos** (_Modern Jester_, 2011)
<lite-youtube videoid="AWarKvO4-h0"></lite-youtube>
Playful loopy papier-mach√© noise with dog sounds! Are you not entertained?

**Paysage d'Hiver - Schatten** (_Kerker_, 1999)
<lite-youtube videoid="rRSVr-MeeSI"></lite-youtube>
Ninth-circle nether ambient. Tobias' most underrated project!

**High Rise - Psychedelic Speed Freaks** (_Psychedelic Speed Freaks '84-'85_, 1985)
<lite-youtube videoid="DbS5OFiswj8" params="start=806"></lite-youtube>
It's rock music, really, in the tradition of Stooges and Les Rallizes Denudes, but it counts for me. YouTube applies some sort of volume normalization; the original recording is LOUD. Also, watch [Wild Zero](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267116).

**Anna Gardeck - Rubber Rituals I** (_Bondage Woman_, 2000)
<lite-youtube videoid="mVclqGZWTaE"></lite-youtube>
Good old-fashioned urban tunnel horror.

**Masonna - \[untitled\] (track 19)** (_Ejaculation Generater_, 1996)
<lite-youtube videoid="BjpNaP9cYU4"></lite-youtube>
One of my goals in making this list is to highlight plenty of music outside comedically harsh J-noise. Here's some comedically harsh J-noise.

**Hanatarash - Hanatara Hopper** (_Hanatarash 3_, 1989)
<lite-youtube videoid="lDL5eBncaaM"></lite-youtube>
The only record store employee who didn't graciously greet me in Japan was the frowning black-clad owner of a noise-focused spot in Osaka. This stuff is even weirder over there!

**Ke/Hil - Work Church Poverty** (_Zone 0_, 2015)
<lite-youtube videoid="iEnlgzc4USQ"></lite-youtube>
Mighty and mysterious. Beautifully unsubtle title. Found in the very sorely missed Aquarius Records, San Francisco.

**Einst√ºrzende Neubauten - Steh auf Berlin** (_Kollaps_, 1981)
<lite-youtube videoid="bK-a02u_GYc"></lite-youtube>
Really industrial industrial. Nice double entendre in the title: "\[Ich\] steh auf Berlin" is slang for roughly "I'm down with Berlin," while "steh auf" as a command means "get up!"

**The Gerogerigegege - G.I. Shit** (_Yellow Trash Bazooka_, 1993)
<lite-youtube videoid="c5qwsSZ_98M" params="start=241"></lite-youtube>
Yeah, just those 10 seconds. 1 2 3 4!!!

**Helm - Candy** (_World in Action_, 2017)
<lite-youtube videoid="CbuaT7Rh82Q"></lite-youtube>
I know, getting too creative with my definition of noise here. Love these textures and how they interact.

**Rainforest Spiritual Enslavement - Refuges From Black Magic** (_Black Magic Cannot Cross Water_, 2013)
<lite-youtube videoid="1PQmuJbv7R0"></lite-youtube>
Basically a 15-minute recording of heavy rain with Minecraft cave sounds. This is the same guy as Prurient. Versatility!

**Gnaw Their Tongues - Then Shall They Come, Oh Master, Shrieking From Red Battle Fields to People Thy Dark Realms** (_To Rend Each Other Like Wild Beasts, Till Earth Shall Reek With Midnight Massacre_, 2009)
<lite-youtube videoid="G8GgvB9C05k"></lite-youtube>
Deep dark black unadulterated sound-evil.

**Ramleh - Spear Flowers** (_Hole in the Heart_, 1987)
<lite-youtube videoid="xtlAC4YimSw"></lite-youtube>
200-foot hydra-headed apocalypse robot advances toward your city.

**Man Is the Bastard - Trapped Within Burning Machinery** (_Untitled / The Brutality Continues..._, 1992)
<lite-youtube videoid="FYDh9cENSBM"></lite-youtube>
Believe it or not these guys are animal rights activists.

**–ó–∞—Ç—É—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–µ - –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–µ–º–æ–Ω** (_–ó–∞—Ç—É—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–µ_, 2012)

_WARNING: TURN DOWN YOUR VOLUME_
<lite-youtube videoid="lKMycotZ_90"></lite-youtube>
Describing extremity is hard. Look, a melody!

**Genocide Organ - Negros in Sky-Wars** (_Leichenlinie_, 1989)
<lite-youtube videoid="N3wluzrKFjc"></lite-youtube>
Clipping industrial savagery. Some vinyl reissues come with a death certificate for a Wehrmacht soldier. üò≥

**Luceran Lycan Haunt - IV. Moonlit Hex...** (_Arcane Arts Bleach the Skulls of the Forbidden_, 2017)
<lite-youtube videoid="KM5CgleC4vU" params="start=336"></lite-youtube>
Dreadful union of trve black metal and noise. Better cue up some cute animal videos afterward.

**Yellow Swans - Going Places** (_Going Places_, 2010)
<lite-youtube videoid="-Fa-vLkj1Fo"></lite-youtube>
Unlike most on this list, this record doesn't want to kill you. Catharsis at the tail of the Portland duo's swan song (heyo!).

**The Gerogerigegege - Boys Don't Cry** (_Tokyo Anal Dynamite_, 1987)
<lite-youtube videoid="09glmnLsnKU"></lite-youtube>
Gotta end with this classic Cure cover. $\Delta S_\text{univ} \geq 0$ and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Make noise, have fun!
