This was fun to do for [noise]({% link _posts/2023-09-13-tour-o-noise.md %}), so why not take a stab at electro?

**Drexciya - Positron Island** (_Bubble Metropolis_, 1993)
<lite-youtube videoid="DU9tef5tXgY"></lite-youtube>
Drexciya is an artist any student of dance music needs to know --- because they're wildly influential, yes, but moreover because the music kicks ass. Every EP from 1992 to 1996 is essential!

**Perception - Mirage** (_Interstellar Fugitives_, 1998)
<lite-youtube videoid="PdkkNf7aqHY"></lite-youtube>
Total classic, sonically and lyrically. Perfectly encapsulates the UR vision of paranoid retrofuture inflected with uncertain optimism.

**Future/Past - Nebula Variation** (_The Philosophy of Sound and Machine_, 1992)
<lite-youtube videoid="E5z5suTyf4M"></lite-youtube>
Standout track from an impossible-to-find compilation wildly ahead of its time.

**Chaos - Afrogermanic** (_Crime Report_, 1996)
<lite-youtube videoid="NlCv0cRthvI"></lite-youtube>
Another UR classic. Gold standard for economy. Ich schwarz deutsch!

**Kuldaboli - Milljón ára** (_Milljón ára en held mér ungum_, 2020)
<lite-youtube videoid="cKZmvUehtpE"></lite-youtube>
This record was engineered in a lab to get me to burn 25 bucks, and it worked!

**Dopplereffekt - Speak & Spell** (_Infophysix_, 1996)
<lite-youtube videoid="mnG8VwHNM-w"></lite-youtube>
Dopplereffekt is, for my money, the most consistently great project in the genre, so you might as well just throw a dart at their Discogs page. But I have a soft spot for this hair-raiser, which is sure to charge up any dance floor.

**Aleksi Perälä - UKMH51900045** (_Resonance_, 2019)
<lite-youtube videoid="CI8bK5a-5JE"></lite-youtube>
Electro is a crass attempt at categorizing this man's beautifully strange music, but sometimes it kinda fits. I recommend taking a dive into the [Colundi](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/colundi-aleksi-perala-interview) universe if you have not.

**Anthony Rother - Sex With the Machines** (_Sex With the Machines_, 1997)
<lite-youtube videoid="fXsTygtDI5Q"></lite-youtube>
Twisting tunneling groovy madness. One of many heavy tracks on this LP.

**Dexter - Intruder** (_Intruder_, 2001)
<lite-youtube videoid="Z4ONs6WEUk4"></lite-youtube>
Ruthlessly economical with just 3 or 4 elements. Love Dexter's tight-lipped sense of whimsy.

**C-System - The Twilight of the Idols** (_World of Vanity_, 2009)
<lite-youtube videoid="BjW_zvzCp50"></lite-youtube>
Not sure what the Nietzschean title is about, but this is some industrial-strength doom electro.

**Rude 66 - Out in Style** (_De wraak der wegpiraten_, 2002)
<lite-youtube videoid="EFjUtqvJcpE"></lite-youtube>
Straight up Hague electro from a founder of the legendary Bunker label.

**OCB - Aquaquest** (_Casa Sports Vol. 1_, 2017)
<lite-youtube videoid="VMV2b2lX7nc"></lite-youtube>
Tasty contemplative stuff from Casablanca's trendy Casa Voyager label.

**Simulant - Optimal Flow** (_SX 12004_, 2000)
<lite-youtube videoid="po156kfWAUE"></lite-youtube>
Sick evil slithery destroyer off a UK label shrouded in mystery. Accessible thanks to a wonderful [Tresor reissue](https://www.discogs.com/release/11087462-Simulant-Pollon-Scopex-9800).

**Los Hermanos - Quetzal** (_Quetzal / Tescat_, 2002)
<lite-youtube videoid="c5YnKB_4jeI"></lite-youtube>
One of the most rejuvenating tracks I know in any style, and a great conclusion to just about any chapter. This one is never leaving my rotation.
