_[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly programming challenge involving 25 puzzles, released daily in December. I published all my solutions for 2021 on [GitHub](https://github.com/plra/aoc-2021). I'm featuring some of the more interesting or odd ones in a series of posts._

For some reason I committed to writing solutions to the first few problems in one-line quasi-functional Python (which, incidentally, is [Turing complete](https://qiita.com/KTakahiro1729/items/c9cb757473de50652374)). Day 4's one-liner is the most hideous of the bunch.

[The problem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) asks us to simulate a gaggle of bingo-playing grannies: given a sequence of `draws` and a set of bingo `boards`, we submit the `score` of whoever wins first.

Here's the code, annotated with pointers to explanations below.

```py
( # (1)
    lambda draws, boards: reduce( # (2)
        lambda score_and_boards, draw: (
            ( # (3)
                lambda boards: (
                    reduce( # (4)
                        lambda score, board: sum(
                            n for row in board for (n, seen) in row if not seen
                        )
                        * draw
                        if score is None
                        and any(
                            all(seen for (_, seen) in row)
                            for b in [board, zip(*board)] # (5)
                            for row in b
                        )
                        else score,
                        boards,
                        None,
                    ),
                    boards,
                )
            )( # (6)
                lmap( # (7)
                    lambda board: lmap(
                        lambda row: lmap(
                            lambda e: (e[0], draw == e[0] or e[1]), row
                        ),
                        board,
                    ),
                    score_and_boards[1],
                )
            )
            if score_and_boards[0] is None
            else score_and_boards # (8)
        ),
        draws,
        (None, boards),
    )[0]
)(*read("input.txt"))
```

1. The form `(lambda t: f(t))(g(x))` allows us to write `f(g(x))` more concisely when `f(t)` has a lot of `t`s. Here, this lets me avoid writing `read("input.txt")[1]` multiple times when I mean `boards`. This pattern is like a less elegant form of [`let ... in` or `where`](https://wiki.haskell.org/Let_vs._Where) from Haskell.

   `read` is just boilerplate. It returns `(draws, boards)`, where `draws` is the list of numbers drawn and `boards` is a list of bingo board states, represented by 5x5 listlists of tuples `(n, seen)` with `seen` initially `False`.
2. This is [`functools.reduce`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce), which is just a [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) in FP lingo; `reduce(f, [x] + xs, a) == reduce(f, xs, f(a, x))`.

   In our case `f` is the lambda at (3), which maps tuples `score_and_boards := (winning score: Maybe int, current board states: [[[(int, bool)]]])` and the current `draw` to a new `score_and_boards` tuple. The iterable to be reduced is `draws`, and the initial value of `score_and_boards` is `(None, boards)`, which indicates that there is initially no winning score and all boards are unmarked.

   At the end of the reduction, we pluck off the `score` from the final tuple.
3. We use the composition trick from (1) again here.
4. This `reduce` searches the updated board states for a winning board, returning the `score` of the first `board` with a complete row or column of `seen` entries, or `None` if none exists. We assume that there is no tie for first.
5. `zip(*board)` is the transpose of `board`; its rows are columns of `board`.
6. To update board states, for each board we flip the `seen` bit of each entry if matches the current `draw`.
7. Our `lmap` is just the composition `list . map`. These lines would be less obnoxious as a list comprehension.
8. We stop searching for a win if someone has already won.

Here's the equivalent procedural code:

```py
draws, boards = read("input.txt") # (1)
for draw in draws: # (2)
    for i, board in enumerate(boards): # (4)
        boards[i] = [ # (6)
            [(n, draw == n or seen) for (n, seen) in row]
            for row in board
        ]
        if any(
            all(seen for (_, seen) in row)
            for b in [boards[i], zip(*boards[i])] # (5)
            for row in b
        ):
            return draw * sum(
                n for row in boards[i] for (n, seen) in row if not seen
            )
```

A third as many lines as the "one-liner" (according to black, at least), and perhaps a bit more readable.
