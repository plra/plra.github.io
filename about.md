I'm Pablo Aldape. I'm interested in music, math, computer science, statistics, language, finance and some other things. I'm employed as a data scientist (f.k.a. quantitative analyst) at Google, working on recommender systems for YouTube Shorts. Before that I did applied cryptography at a startup. I graduated from Stanford with degrees in mathematics and statistics. I live in NYC.

Aldape is a [place](https://mapcarta.com/18606752) in Basque country. It loosely translates to "at the foot of the mountain."
