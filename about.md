Nice for you to meet me, I'm Pablo! I'm interested in music, math, computer science, statistics, language, finance and some other things. I'm ~~employed as a data scientist (f.k.a. quantitative analyst) at Google, working on recommender systems for YouTube Shorts~~ an unemployed bum. Before that I did applied cryptography at a startup. I graduated from Stanford with degrees in mathematics and statistics. I live in NYC.
